## 04 August - 08 August 2024: Agen Allwedd

**People**: Benedict, Alex, Sarah

**Duration**: Quite long

‘What would you say to a wee of digging Aggy? I really dislike the streamway in twice in a weekend.’ - Benedict
Notice the typo ‘wee’, initially I read this as the Scottish kinda wee, like ‘a little bit of digging’ No, he was proposing a week underground. This sounded like a brilliant idea, I also dislike the streamway in question.
Time was difficult to find and the plan for a week turned into 4 days. We could have done 5 but that would have left me with less than 24 hours to get from South Wales to Newcastle Airport. 24 hours was acceptable, less than 24 hours stressful.
A day or so before the scheduled digging camp Alex spontaneously decided to join us, coming straight from a different caving trip which I think was somewhere in the Peaks?
Sunday evening, we headed into Aggy. I will probably continue writing this at some point. For now, there’s an excellent summary by Alex on UKCaving.
All in all, an excellent trip, can’t think of a better way to have spent my last few days in the UK (until December).
