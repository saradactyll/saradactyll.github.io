## 16/02-17/02: Agen Allwedd Camp

**People**: Sarah, Alex, Paul, Dave, Nick.  also in cave: Colin, Leonie, Dylan, Mathilde
**Duration**: Saturday 3am - Sunday 3:45pm

Some time after 2 I'm dropped off by Whitewalls, assuring my (very nice) driver I was not alone on the mountain and there were people waiting for me. This was all true, I did neglect to mention they were waiting a couple miles underground. 
3.15 am solo cave down to Priory Road Camp, arriving at about 7:30am. This was my first proper experience of caving alone and I really enjoyed it. Highlights included repeating a stretch of Southern Stream to retrieve a fallen bag, and dragging my inflated ancient thermorest half the way down priory road after underestimating how far along camp was. Overall went shockingly well without any navigation issues (I had expected to get confused towards the end of the entrance series and potentially also the last section around ribbed vault.) 
When I got close to camp I set up and 'slept' for a couple of hours, lights appeared down the passage just before 11. Mathilde and Dylan had arrived on a day trip. 
Quick introductions then we wandered the last 10m or so into camp where the 6 that had arrived the previous night were just waking up.
We all crowded around the two camp tables for cups of tea and breakfast, eventually changing back into caving gear and heading off to the dig sometime after 12.
We went via Glevum hall and Severn beach involving a couple of very low 'sand swim' crawls, made extra entertaining pulling along some planks. I definitely ate some dirt. The consensus is that this is the easy route but personally I think I prefer via Iles Inlet, has nice soft sand and there's a few squeezes but most of it's quite fun. We reach the Old Diggers Camp and make a chain to move rocks from the crawl down to the dig face out into the Old diggers camp. Paul shows up with the news that numbers are down from 9 to 7. We then set about digging in ernest. With 2 people down in the dig, the rest of us spread at strategic points to haul up and guide the spoil tray up to the 'surface'. For the first couple hours of this I had the luxury of a spot where I could fully sit up - although this was right next to (but not under) the sketchy looking boulder. The day trippers then left to begin the long journey out leaving 5 of us. For moving stuff out the dig its really ideal to have more than 5 people. 8 is probably about optimum. As a result Alex and I move further down into the dig, I alternated between hauling and stacking rocks in a corner. Progress did speed up as we figured out how to make the most of the two to one pulley system, but still the rocks were arriving much faster than I could redistribute them and was glad when we stopped for a lunch break probably around 5 or 6. We then switched up places and I got my first look at the dig face, behind Alex digging, moving the spoil into the tray then pushing it through the little tunnel thing (first useful application of long legs this entire cave) to be moved into the second tray by Dave. This was a great job, right next to the speakers, with Dave updating me on what had been done so far. At some point Alex and Dave switched over and the drilling was interrupted every now and then with Alex asking if I knew x or y joke. This carried on to about 9pm by which point I was definitely feeling tired and sleep deprived. Alex, Nick and I then head back to camp, shortly followed by Paul after he'd done some surveying, and then Dave who was quite unhappy we'd left him a heavy bag. A communal dinner of curry and rice, we stayed up for a few hours before heading to sleep sometime after 2am. I then had the best cave sleep of my life and woke up around 10:30am feeling much fresher and still warm! Leonie had left her food behind yesterday which made a quite substantial breakfast of dense seedy bread and peanut butter. We cleaned up the camp a bit. I packed my sleeping stuff into a wet bag before scrawling my name on it to be left it in the cave. This should make future trips much more pleasant. Paul heads off early to begin the mammoth task of filling all the bottles from Southern Stream. Nick and I leave camp at 12.15 to head to the surface at a much more leisurely pace exiting the cave about quarter to 4.
